    "### This blog serves as a space to track progress made with Dr. Robin Wordsworth and for me to brainstorm ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Broad scope goals:\n",
    "- Characterize atmospheric ozone chemistry in a system where the OH abundance is prescribed\n",
    "- Use a vertically-resolved 1D chemistry model with diffusion to calculate the ozone column abundance on Earth-like exoplanets with varying atmospheric pressure, O2 abundance, and received stellar fluxes\n",
    "- Investigate the observability of ozone in these cases and the extent to which this may allow us to retrieve info on total atmospheric pressure and O2 abundance on such planets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "##### These goals are motivated by prior work that assesses the robustness of detectable atmospheric molecular oxygen as a biosignature. Oxygen on Earth is in thermodynamic disequilibrium, indicative of a replenishing source. That source is largely biotic. It has been suggested that oxygen may also be formed abiotically in low pressure environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### A photochemical byproduct of molecular oxygen is ozone, largely produced by photolysis of molecular oxygen in the UV and subsequent oxidation of O2 by atomic oxygen. Ozone is readily detactable remotely. However, it is likely quite scarce in low-pressure, Earth-like atmospheres, even in the presence of oxygen, due to higher water concentrations in the upper atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### On Earth, water is cold trapped near the tropopause where it condenses and returns to the surface and lower altitudes. The cold trapping mechanism prevents significant accumulation of water vapor in the upper atmosphere where it may be photolyzed to produce hydroxyl radicals and initiate HOx cycling and ozone degradation. Theory suggests that a significant non-condensing gas inventory is required for effective cold trapping. Cold trapping may therefore less efficient in a low pressure atmosphere. It is concievable that catalytic ozone degradation is more efficient than on Earth in such an environment, even in the presence of signficant O2. Ozone abundance has the potential to serve as an indicator for atmospheric surface pressure, especially in atmospheres with significant water content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research questions:\n",
    "- Can ozone abundance be used as a proxy for atmospheric surface pressure in some cases?\n",
    "- How does ozone behave in a range of planetary conditions?\n",
    "    - Characterize ozone chemistry in a range of atmospheres with different pressures, stellar flux distributions, temperatures, aerosol/haze/cloud abundances, molecular abundances, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Week 1\n",
    "- Completed Chapter 10: Stratospheric Ozone in 'Intro to Atmospheric Chemistry' by Daniel Jacobs.\n",
    "    - Outlines the Chapman mechanism for photolytic production/degradation of ozone and atomic oxygen. This mechanism could not account for lower observed ozone levels in the stratosphere (factor of about 2). Many ozone sinks were discovered that could explain the discrepancy. These sinks primarily consist of catalytic degradation cycles involving hydrogen oxide radicals (HOx), nitrogen oxide radicals (NOx/NOy), chlorine radicals (ClOx/Cly), and in the antarctic spring, ClO dimerization and bromine radicals - both feeding into the ClOx/Cly catalytic cycles. The chapter also discusses the importance of aerosol chemistry in explaining the unexpected ozone loss at midlatitudes in previous decades. Dinitrogen pentoxide rapidly reacts with water on aerosol surfaces to produce nitric acid. This ultimately slows ozone degradation by NOx but increases it by ClOx and HOx cycles.\n",

    "Meeting w/ Dr. Wordsworth July 2, 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chapter 10 problems\n",
    "    - Builds intuition – useful and worthwhile.\n",
    "    - Radiation is attenuated not like Beer’s law because the air density increases exponentially with decreasing altitude. Hydrostatic balance – pressure and gravity. Look at this in the text. Barometric law is same as hydrostatic equilibrium. Chapter 2 covers this. Equation 2.12 is density in terms of (z), the missing piece of the puzzle for first Chapter 10.\n",
    "    - Another exercise is to take the derivative of the function and find extreme to find the altitude of maximum photolysis rate.\n",
    "    - 10.3 – can ignore for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Moving on to next steps – the model\n",
    "    - Would like to look at Chapman mech and just HOx for now for simple model.\n",
    "    - Working w/ matlab for first 1D model, currently working.\n",
    "    - Would like to move to Python. Needs a few weeks to get it into Python. Start with 0-D model.\n",
    "        - 2 parts – chemistry and atmospheric transport, 1D vs 0-D difficulties\n",
    "    - In the meantime – work on problems and read more. Also look at the cross section website - http://satellite.mpic.de/spectral_atlas\n",
    "        - Find ozone cross sections, download them, plot them (w/ Python), look at how photolysis rates are functions of altitude. \n",
    "        - Get cross section, use w/ stellar spectrum data, then get ozone reaction rates.\n",
    "        - Note to self: these cross sections don’t account for scattering. Robin’s mental model: photon = bullet, molecule = target, if the photon hits the cross section (cm^2/molecule), absorption occurs. \n",
    "        - Robin will also send some spectral data to incorporate. "

    "- Attended the Sagan Exoplanet Summer Workshop on extreme precision radial velocity techniques (EPRV)\n",
    "- Completed Jacob Chapter 10 problems\n",
    "- Completed Jacob Chapters 1-2 (Measures of atm. comp. and pressure) w/ problems\n",
    "- Absorption cross sections for O2, quantum yeilds, and incident solar flux at the top of the atmosphere were used to calculate photodissociation rates for singlet and triplet oxygen production - https://github.com/cjcollin37/Wordsworth/blob/master/Oxygen%20Photolysis.ipynb. Altitude dependence was ignored.\n",
    "    - The rate of oxygen photolysis to produce __triplet oxygen__ ignoring dependence on altitude was found to be 7.2e16 molecules/s per cubic meter of air. This comes from using air density at sea level and the solar flux from the top of the atmosphere. The number density of air decreases with altitude and the stellar flux increases with altitude. Hence, the actual rate is expected to be much lower when accounting for altitude.\n",
    "    - The rate of oxygen photolysis to produce __singlet oxygen__ ignoring dependence on altitude is 1.52e20 molecules/s per cubic meter of air. This is 4 orders of magnitude higher than the photolysis rate to produce triplet oxygen. This is consistent with the signficantly higher absorption cross section in the 100 - 175 nm range for singlet oxygen compared to that in the 175 nm - 242 nm range for triplet oxygen. This difference is significant enough to dominate over the influence of lower stellar flux in the 100 - 175 nm range."
